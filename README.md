# lab-interp

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/lab-interp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/lab-interp)

This is a slimmed down version of [d3's lab color interpolation](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Colors)
logic.

Differences from d3's lab interpolation method:

* No support for CSS named colors
this repo already has a travis hook
